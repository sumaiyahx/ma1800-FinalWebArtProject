For my web-art project, I decided to base it off of memes. This is because memes are the common language of the internet, which therefore makes them a huge part of online culture. Memes explore the internet as a medium through how easy they are to be shared and by showing how ideas spread and evolve online. I decided to do it on memes as they highlight the participatory nature of digital culture, as audiences can actively create and adapt meaning. 

At the beginning of this project I struggled with the coding and how to structure my website. To resolve this, I looked back at the previous codes we did in the workshops and in terms of aesthetics, I had a look at a few of the case studies that were on Moodle. I was most inspired by the ‘Art meets radical Openness- Lost in the Garden of Clouds Exhibition' where one of their pages had images of watches dropping down from the top of the page. It took me a while to figure out how to get my images to drop and it took a lot of experimenting before I managed to get it to work. A similar thing occurred when I was trying to add sound to page 1 as it wasn’t working the first few times .One thing I was stuck on for a while and didn’t manage to fix was the button on the index page that is supposed to take you straight to page 3. I tried different ways to line it up with the other two buttons but I did not manage it. 

I went onto google fonts to find a font I thought would suit the title on the first two pages as VS code didn’t have the font that I was looking for. While I was doing research on the Dancing Baby meme, I discovered that there was a song that played while it danced. I looked it up on Audacity and decided to incorporate it in that page as it suited the theme.  I also quite enjoyed using Paint to create the backgrounds on page 1 and 3. I put it in VS code as an image and then I set it to fit the background.

Overall I now feel more confident when it comes to coding independently than when I first started as I now know what to look out for. Before I was making silly mistakes such as forgetting the semi colon at the end or misspelling a word which would cause errors amongst the code. If I had more time I would have definitely added extra pages and I would have spent more on why the button for page 3 was not working.
